**Storing a Static Website on Amazon Web Services Simple Storage
Service**

This is a paid cloud public cloud storage service offered by AWS for the
storage of objects which consists of data and metadata. We can think of
AWS S3 buckets as file folders in the cloud.

**Creating an AWS S3 bucket.**

From your AWS account, select **AWS management console**, thereafter,
type **S3** in the search bar underneath **Find Services.** Select
**S3.** On the next page click create bucket and fill in the name of
your bucket(this name is globally unique, hence, you can't use a name
already used by another AWS user).
